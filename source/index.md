Hi, my name is Chris Whitley, better known as Aristurtle online in different game development communities.  I've been making games in some fashion since I was a kid. Quirky ascii graphics in QBasic, dungeon crawlers on TI-86, and experiments with RPG Maker 95. Those are all projects that will be lost to time forever. More recently though, I've grown incredibly fond of the MonoGame Framework and work primarily in that now. Below, you can find the games I've released publicly over the past several years.
