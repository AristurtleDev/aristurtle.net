# Collision Detection Introduction
In this tutorial series, we're going to discuss two different methods of collision detection used in 2D games.  These methods are:

- Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB)
- Circle Collision

As we discuss each of these methods, we're going to create an implementation of them in a new MonoGame 3.8.1.303 game project.

## Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to create a brand new MonoGame game project.  For the purposes of this tutorial and the supplied project files, I'll be creating a **MonoGame Cross Platform Desktop** (DesktopGL) project.

## Project Files
You can find the completed version of the projected created with this demo at https://github.com/AristurtleDev/aristurlte-tutorial-files/tree/main/collision-detection-tutorial
