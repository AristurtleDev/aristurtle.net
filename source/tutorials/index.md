    - In this tutorial series we discuss collision detection between two rectangles using **Axis-Aligned Bounding Box** (AABB) detection as well as detecting collision between two circles.
- [MonoGame Content Pipeline Extension](./content-pipeline-extension/01_introduction.md)
    - This tutorial is a deep dive series where we discuss creating your own content pipeline extension for the MGCB Editor and go over the anatomy of each part of the processes.  By the end of the tutorial you will have created a custom JSON content extension for the MGCB Editor.
